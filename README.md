# kanna-beta-rpg

This was supposed to be a prequel to the main RPG that focused on Kanna. It was my attempt at making a smaller-scale game to be able to finish something.
While the idea was good and I'd like to do something like this again, the story is obselete with new developments. Additionally, I found that my sprites
were too refined. Next time around, I'd take a more unpolished approach to visuals, as I AM one person.

## Story

This game depicts Kanna's journey in the underground realm which is inhabited by the Fox deity. The deity welcomes her arrival and encourages her to leave to the 
surface world (earth as we know it) to destroy everything on their behalf, since they do not have a solid physical body and Kanna does. The game ends
when Kanna exits the underground and enters the overworld, finally seeing a reflection of herself in a dimly-lit bathroom mirror. </br>

I still think the sprites I made for the walk cycle and Fox deity are pretty cute, though.
